# Aurora Student Club — Mini Website


## Theme
A fictional student organization showcasing projects, events, and a contact form. This is built using **only HTML5** to demonstrate semantic structure, navigation, forms, tables, and media embedding.


## Files
- `index.html` — Home page with articles and images.
- `about.html` — Purpose, figure, and semantic tags.
- `services.html` — Projects table using thead/tbody/tfoot.
- `contact.html` — Contact form with fieldset/legend and form controls.
- `assets/` — images and media used by the site.


## Organization
Place all images in `assets/images` and media in `assets/media`. Use relative paths (e.g., `assets/images/event1.jpg`).


## Challenges faced
- Styling isn't available: Since the assignment forbids CSS, layout and visual polish rely on structural HTML.
- Accessibility: Ensuring semantic tags and proper labels for form controls.


## GitHub delivery
1. Create a repository and push files.
2. Add `alidaghighi` as collaborator if the repo is private.
